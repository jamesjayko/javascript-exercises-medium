<!-- Medium Challenge: Trapping Water
Using the JavaScript language, have the function TrappingWater(arr) take the array of non-negative integers stored in arr, and determine the largest amount of water that can be trapped. The numbers in the array represent the height of a building (where the width of each building is 1) and if you imagine it raining, water will be trapped between the two tallest buildings. For example: if arr is [3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4] then this array of building heights looks like the following picture if we draw it out: 

									_ _
 _ _             |   |
|   |     _ _    |   |
|   |    |   |   |   |
|   |____|   |_ _|   |

Now if you imagine it rains and water gets trapped in this picture, then it'll look like the following (the x's represent water): 

 								 _ _
 _ _            |   |
|   |xxxxxxxxxxx|   |
|   |xxxx|   |xx|   |
|   |xxxx|   |xx|   |

This is the most water that can be trapped in this picture, and if you calculate the area you get 10, so your program should return 10.
